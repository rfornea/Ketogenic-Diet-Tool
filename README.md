# Macro-and-Calorie-Tool--Javascript-HTML-CSS

This repository has my webpage tool that I made to track macros and calories.  
It includes the foods I normally eat, but the user can access the HTML and Javascript and add their own foods.  

This page uses Javascript but the Javascript is in the HTML file itself rather than a separate file.  Everytime 
the page is reloaded all the text fields reset.  The totals update automatically as the user adds servings of different
foods.  The goal is just to stay at a caloric deficit and keep carbs below 20.
